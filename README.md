# SCS Gap-Filled Remote Sensing Chl-a dataset

The **gap-filled** reconstruction based on OC-CCIv4.2 is Chl-a concentration dataset in SCS from 2005 to 2019. The temporal and spatial resolution of the dataset is daily and 4km. 
The accuracy and application of the dataset could refer to our research: [Wang et al, 2021, IEEE TGRS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9393603)
